Hi, I'm SirensAndiPhones. I make websites along with my friends (who are not on github.) Some of my websites include Science Class, Turtle Start Page, Paint-a-turtle, and CensorTurtle.
I make websites on a Chromebook and code mostly in HTML. My hobbies include coding, Hornex.PRO, YouTube, and collecting electronics.
